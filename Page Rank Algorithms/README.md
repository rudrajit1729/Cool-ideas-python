Page rank algorithms.
This simple logic is used at backend in google.Webpages treated as nodes and hyperlinks as edges thus forming world wide web of network.
Ranking the webpages based on certain parameters and hence according to the rank displaying search results is what google does till date.
Keep exploring more online.
Here I covered two widely used approaches for page rank implementing using python.
1)Random walk approach:-
	This method takes a random walk around the graph starting from a random node.Increases point of node after each visit to node.
	The node with highest visit is the first result when keyword is searched for. 
2)Point distribution approach:-
	This method initializes equal points to all nodes.Then distributes points from each node to its neighbours.
	Repeat the process till values converge to a particular state.
